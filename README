Port of the Histogram() function from Avisynth.

All modes dealing with video are implemented
(classic, levels, color, color2, luma).

To compile in Linux (and possibly other Unix-like systems):
clang -shared -fPIC -o libhistogram.so *.c

Currently only tested in Linux.

A win32 dll can be found in the Downloads section.
